Hello-World application is here! (Now I know git push and stuff...)

At first, the program is going to ask which language do 
you want it to print "Hello World!" in. There are two input options: ```en``` (English) and ```bg``` (Bulgarian). Other inputs are not going to be accepted for this current release of the program.

This is everything you need to take into concideration when using this program! Hope you enjoy! :)
